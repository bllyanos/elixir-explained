# Managing Child Processes in Elixir with GenServer: Linking, Monitoring, and Supervision Patterns

In Elixir applications, GenServers often manage dynamic tasks and temporary workers. One common pattern is a GenServer managing a multiplayer match, with related processes like timers running alongside. In this article, we explore robust patterns for:

- Handling GenServer crashes
- Spawning and linking child processes (like timers)
- Monitoring and reacting to child exits
- Lifecycle management without full-blown supervision trees

Letâ€™s walk through this with a simple multiplayer match process and an associated timer.

---

## 1. GenServer Crash Behavior

When a GenServer crashes, its linked processes are also terminated unless theyâ€™re supervised separately or explicitly unlinked. By default, any state held in the GenServer is lost unless it's restored externally (e.g., from a database or ETS).

### ðŸ”¥ Example

```elixir
defmodule MatchServer do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(match_id) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{id: match_id, players: [], timer_ref: nil}, name: via(match_id))
  end

  defp via(id), do: {:via, Registry, {MyApp.MatchRegistry, id}}
end
```

If `MatchServer` crashes, all internal state is gone â€” including any reference to a timer.

---

## 2. Spawning Child Processes from a GenServer

To start related child processes (like a countdown timer), use `DynamicSupervisor`. This ensures the timer is supervised and restartable.

```elixir
defmodule TimerServer do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(duration_ms) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, duration_ms)
  end

  def init(duration) do
    Process.send_after(self(), :done, duration)
    {:ok, duration}
  end

  def handle_info(:done, state) do
    Process.exit(self(), :normal)
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

In `MatchServer`, spawn the timer like this:

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MatchTimerSupervisor, {TimerServer, 5_000})
```

You **do not** need another supervisor inside your GenServer. Let a separate `DynamicSupervisor` (defined in your app supervision tree) manage timer lifecycles.

---

## 3. Monitoring and Being Notified of Child Process Termination

Use `Process.monitor/1` to get `:DOWN` messages when a child terminates.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MatchTimerSupervisor, {TimerServer, 5_000})
ref = Process.monitor(pid)
{:noreply, %{state | timer_ref: ref}}
```

Then handle it in `handle_info/2`:

```elixir
def handle_info({:DOWN, ref, :process, _pid, reason}, state) do
  IO.puts("Timer finished or crashed: #{inspect(reason)}")
  broadcast_timer_complete()
  {:noreply, %{state | timer_ref: nil}}
end
```

---

## 4. Starting and Linking a Related Timer Process

If you want the timer to **crash when the match crashes**, link it:

```elixir
pid = spawn_link(fn -> run_timer(5_000) end)
```

Or with a GenServer:

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(TimerServer, 5_000)
Process.link(pid)
```

You can **link and monitor** at the same time if you want crash propagation **and** notifications:

```elixir
Process.link(pid)
ref = Process.monitor(pid)
```

---

## 5. Handling Events When the Timer Completes Normally

Youâ€™ll get a `:DOWN` message with reason `:normal` if the timer exits gracefully.

```elixir
def handle_info({:DOWN, _ref, :process, _pid, :normal}, state) do
  broadcast("match:timer_done", %{match_id: state.id})
  {:noreply, state}
end
```

This is where you can trigger side effects like ending the match, notifying players, etc.

---

## 6. Ensuring Child Processes Terminate When Parent Crashes

To kill the timer if the match crashes, use `Process.link/1`. This makes sure both live and die together.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(TimerServer, 5_000)
Process.link(pid)
```

If `MatchServer` crashes, the linked `TimerServer` will receive an exit signal and shut down too.

---

## 7. Stopping or Cleaning Up All Child Processes When Parent Terminates

Rather than supervising timers under the match GenServer, use `link` for simple lifecycle tie-ins. No need to manage child pids manually or trap exits unless you want fine-grained shutdown.

Alternatively, trap exits and clean up manually:

```elixir
def init(state) do
  Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)
  {:ok, state}
end

def terminate(_reason, state) do
  if state.timer_pid, do: Process.exit(state.timer_pid, :kill)
end
```

## 8. High-Level Pattern Summary

| Technique                      | Use Case                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `DynamicSupervisor`           | Start child GenServers dynamically               |
| `Process.monitor/1`           | Be notified when a process terminates            |
| `Process.link/1`              | Crash child when parent crashes                  |
| `handle_info({:DOWN, ...})`   | React to child finishing/crashing                |
| Manual cleanup / `terminate`  | Kill children on exit if not linked              |

## Conclusion

When building systems like multiplayer matches in Elixir, managing related processes like timers can be simple and robust:

- Use `DynamicSupervisor` for child management.
- Use `monitor` to react to child exits.
- Use `link` to tie process lifecycles.
- Let the parent handle side effects like broadcasting or cleanup.

This pattern scales well without needing a full supervision tree per GenServer. Perfect for simple, fault-tolerant multiplayer games.
